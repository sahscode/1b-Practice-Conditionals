# Compute the smaller root of a quadratic equation.
# Given numbers a, b, and c, the quadratic equation ax2+bx+c=0 
# can have zero, one or two real solutions (i.e; values for x 
# that satisfy the equation). The quadratic formula
# x=−b±b2−4ac√2a
# can be used to compute these solutions. The expression b2−4ac
# is the discriminant associated with the equation. If the 
# discriminant is positive, the equation has two solutions. 
# If the discriminant is zero, the equation has one solution. 
# Finally, if the discriminant is negative, the equation has no solutions.

# Write a Python function smaller_root that takes an input the numbers 
# a, b and c and returns the smaller solution to this equation if one 
# exists. If the equation has no real solution, print the message 
# "Error: No real solutions" and simply return. Note that, in this case, 
# the function will actually return the special Python value None.
